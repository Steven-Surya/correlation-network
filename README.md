# Clustering Using Correlation Network

The purpose of this project is to introduce an alternative clustering method to k-means clustering.
Eventhough k-means is a low complexity clustering method that can be done fast and quite reliable, k-means has many downsides.
Some of them are as follows.
Since k-means solely rely on mean value as its cluster consideration, k-means is not effective against data that contains many outliers 
(because the outlier points will dominate most of the clusters, which force us to choose large number of k).
It is also tricky to find the proper k for k-means.
Lastly, k-means tends to be inconsistent, since it is basically generated by random centroids.

The idea here is, I create a network from a dataframe instead of using a dataframe directly for clustering.
There are many ideas to create a network from a dataframe, in this case, I start with a simple idea of correlation network.
The correlation network itself is not a new object, as it is used in many subjects already (such as in bio-informatics).
So, for a specified threshold, only if two data points has correlation value more than that threshold, we create a line that connects them.
After a network is established, then I implement community detection algorithm for a network 
(in this case, I use 'infomap' algorithm from `tidygraph` package).

The result is as follows

The choice of the threshold itself already creating some kind of disjoint components that looks like clusters already. 
But, by implementing an additional community detection algorithm, we get additional hidden clusters inside those components.
